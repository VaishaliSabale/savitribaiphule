        <p class="lead text-center">
            Savitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 at the village of Naigaon in Satara District, Maharashtra. Her birthplace is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from Shirval and about 50 km (31 mi) from Pune.[8] Savitribai Phule was the youngest daughter of Lakshmi and just Patil, both of whom belonged to the Mali Community.[9] She had three siblings.[10] Savitribai married her husband Jyotirao Phule at the age of 9 or 10 (he was 13). Though they had no children of their own.[11][12] O'Hanlon, Rosalind (2002). Caste, Conflict and Ideology: Mahatma Jyotirao Phule and Low Caste Protest in Nineteenth-Century Western India (Revised ed.). Cambridge University Press. p. 135. ISBN 978-0-521-52308-0.</ref> It is said that Yashwant was unable to get married because he was born to a widow, and community beliefs disallowed marriage of "such people". Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February of 1889.[13]

                        <p class="card-text">Savitribai was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Jyotirao educated Savitribai and Sagunabai Shirsagar, his cousin sister at their home along with working at their farm.[9][14] Once she completed her primary education with Jyotirao, her further education was the responsibility of his friends, Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar.[15][additional citation(s) needed]She also enrolled herself in two teacher's training programs; the first was at institution run by an American missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar, and the second course was at a Normal School in Poona (Now Pune).[8][9][14] Given her training, Savitribai may have been the first Indian woman teacher and headmistress.[8</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Savitribai and Jyotirao had no children of their own.[11][12] It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. However, there is no original evidence available yet to support this.[5] It is said when Yashwant was about to get married, no one was willing to give him a girl because he was born to a widow. Hence, Savitribai probably arranged his marriage to her organization's worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February 1889.[13]</p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Career</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at Poona. She did so alongside Sagunabai Kshirsagar, sister of Jyotiba Phule[2] who was a revolutionary feminist as well as a mentor to Jyotirao.[citation needed] Not long after beginning to teach with Sagunabai, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule along with Sagunabai started their own school at Bhidewada. Bhidewada was the home of Tatya Saheb Bhide, who was inspired by the work that the trio was doing. The curriculum at Bhidewada included traditional western curriculum of mathematics, science, and social studies.

                            By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were running three different schools for girls in Pune. Combined, the three schools had approximately one hundred and fifty students enrolled. Like the curriculum, the teaching methods employed by the three schools differed from those used in government schools. The author Divya Kandukuri believes that the Phule methods were regarded as being superior to those used by government schools. As a result of this reputation, the number of girls receiving their education at the Phule's schools outnumbered the number of boys enrolled in government schools.[9]
                            
                            Unfortunately, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule's success came with much resistance from the local community with conservative views. Kandukuri states that Savitribai often travelled to her school carrying an extra sari because she would be assailed by her conservative opposition with stones, dung, and verbal abuse. Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were living at Jyotirao's father's home. However, in 1839, Jyotirao's father asked the couple to leave his home because their work was considered a sin.
                            
                            After moving out of Jyotirao's father's home, the Phule's moved in with the family of one of Jyotirao's friends, Usman Sheikh. It was there that Savitribai met a soon to be close friend and colleague named Fatima Begum Sheikh. According to Nasreen Sayyed, a leading scholar on Sheikh, "Fatima Sheikh knew how to read and write already, her brother Usman who was a friend of Jyotiba, had encouraged Fatima to take up the teacher training course. She went along with Savitribai to the Normal School and they both graduated together. She was the first Muslim woman teacher of India". Fatima and Savitribai opened a school in Sheikh's home in 1849.[9]
                            
                            In the 1850s, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule established two educational trusts. They were entitled: the Native Male School, Pune and the Society for Promoting the Education of Mahar, Mangs, and etc. These two trusts ended up encompassing many schools which were led by Savitribai Phule and later, Fatima Sheikh.[9]
                            
                            Jyotirao summarises Savitribai and his work in an interview given to the Christian missionary periodical, Dnyanodaya, on 15 September 1853, saying,
                            It did occur to me that the improvement that comes about in a child due to the mother is very important and good. So those who are concerned with the happiness and welfare of this country should definitely pay attention to the condition of women and make every effort to impart knowledge to them if they want the country to progress. With this thought, I started the school for girls first. But my caste brethren did not like that I was educating girls and my own father threw us out of the house. Nobody was ready to give space for the school nor did we have money to build it. People were not willing to send their children to school but Lahuji Ragh Raut Mang and Ranba Mahar convinced their caste brethren about the benefits of getting educated.[8]
                            
                            Together with her husband, she taught children from different castes and had opened a total of 18 schools.[16] The couple also opened a care centre called Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha[5] (transl.â€‰Centre to stop child killing) for pregnant rape victims and helped deliver and save their children.[17]</p>
